# 🤝 Contributing to Awesome Data Science Toolkit

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug 🐛
- Discussing the current state of the code 💬
- Submitting a fix 🔧
- Proposing new features ✨
- Becoming a maintainer 👑

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## 📝 Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
3. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs
4. **Ensure tests pass** locally
5. **Make sure your code follows** our style guidelines
6. **Issue the pull request**!

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/galafis/awesome-data-science-toolkit/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## 🎨 Coding Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8
- **Docstrings**: Use Google style
- **Comments**: Write meaningful comments
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
